## Tables
Tables are great for presenting tabular data. Think Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets and should only be used in this fashion. 

Unfortunately, tables have been used for the creation and construction of web pages *(pretty much a huge no-no)* and are still used on the web in the form of emails. A majority of the emails you recieve from marketers are typically in a `<table>`.

```
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Jill</td>
                <td>Smith</td>
                <td>50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>John</td>
                <td>Jones</td>
                <td>32</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
```

Tables may also take on the structural look of the `<html>` tag as well, which has a `head` and `<body>` tag. Tables may have a `<thead>` and `<tbody>` to separate your table further.

```
        <table>

            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Jill</th>
                    <th>Smith</th>
                    <th>50</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Jill</td>
                    <td>Smith</td>
                    <td>50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>John</td>
                    <td>Jones</td>
                    <td>32</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>

        </table>
```
