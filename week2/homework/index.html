<p>So she made a checklist to decide if she should take a magical coding odyssey through WebDev1.</p>
<p>She had a website already:
<ul>
<li><a href="www.sammichancey.com">This is that website</a></li>
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>But did she know how to edit HTML?</td>
<td>Nope</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Did she know what CSS meant?</td>
<td>Negative</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Could she make significant changes to her website without assistance?</td>
<td>Definitely not</td>
</tr>
<p>The decision was clear. She would take Yee Yang's class and take over the internet one line of code at a time.</p>
