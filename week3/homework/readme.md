# Homework Instructions - Week 3

To review the [lecture](../lecture/).

## Directions and Homework Requirements
+ Create a file inside the `week3/homework` folder named `index.html` & `style.css`
+ In the `index.html` file, set up the `doctype`, `head`, and `body`. 
+ Create a title inside the `head`: title the page, Homework 3 - by [Your Name]
+ In the `style.css` file, hook up your classes and id attributes to target your elements in your HTML file.

Add some style to your life story!

You've written a page about your life story, now lets add some style and character to your webpage. You can get creative with how you do this but try to figure out layout issues on your own before asking for help. If you can't get it within an hour or so after 'googling', then reach out for help.

** Turn in your homework:
+ Upload the `week3` folder to your Circuslabs web server (using FTP)
+ In a browser window, browse to the `week3` folder you just uploaded to your server and copy the URL
+ Upload your files to Github and in your commit message, include the copy of the URL
+ **Due by Monday morning @ 2:00 am**

## Style examples
```
    .header {
        font-size: 32px;
        font-weight: 700;
        padding: 7px 0 9px 0; // notice how the short-hand is written
        text-transform: uppercase;
    }

    .hero {
        background-image: url('images/someBackground.jpg');
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: left top;
        background-color: #ffffff;
    }
```

Though I could potentially put more here, it probably won't help you as directly as you asking questions. So ask and we can setup a [Pen](http://codepen.io/) together to see the code you're trying to execute.

Don't forget Slack is also a viable option as well.

Good luck and have a good week!
