 <h2>There once was a copywriter who didn't know how to code.</h2>
 <p>So she made a checklist to decide if she should take a magical coding odyssey through WebDev1.</p>
 <p>She had a website already:
<a href="www.sammichancey.com">it looked like this</a>
 </p>
 <table>
 <tr>
 <td>But did she know how to edit HTML?</td>
 <td>Nope</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Did she know what CSS meant?</td>
 <td>Negative</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Could she change her website without help?</td>
 <td>Definitely not</td>
 </tr>
</table>
 <p>The decision was clear. She would take Yee Yang's class and take over the internet one line of code at a time.</p>
